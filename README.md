The user is currently working with Marlin firmware version 2.1.2.5 on a RAMPS 1.4 board configured in EFB mode (Extruder, Fan, Bed). In this configuration, the three main MOSFET outputs are assigned as D10 for 
the extruder heater, D9 for the fan, and D8 for the heated bed. These pins act as high-power switching outputs that pass the board’s supply voltage (12V or 24V) through MOSFETs to the connected load. Alongside
this, the user has successfully controlled a peristaltic pump on the E0 stepper driver slot, using standard G-code commands through Pronterface.

To expand control, the user attempted to utilize one of the MOSFET outputs (D8 or D10) for driving a solenoid valve. For this, the user enabled DIRECT_PIN_CONTROL_FEATURE and PINS_DEBUGGING in Marlin. These 
features are intended to allow manual pin access via G-codes such as M42 (set pin state) and M43 (check/debug pins). While the M43 command functions correctly and lists the available pins, the M42 command fails,
returning an “unknown command” error. This suggests that although the debugging features were enabled, Marlin 2.1.2.5 restricts or relocates direct pin control functionality, and additional configuration is 
required before the pins can be toggled with G-code.

In summary, the EFB mode on RAMPS 1.4 operates normally for heaters and fans, and the stepper drivers work as expected. However, to integrate custom hardware such as a solenoid valve, the firmware must explicitly 
support M42 pin control or be modified to remap the MOSFET pins in pins_RAMPS.h, enabling them to be controlled through existing heater or fan commands. This customization would allow the user to fully integrate
both the pump and cryocan solenoid into the Marlin-controlled system.
